             before Simba is old enough to take his rightful place.</p>

After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa, Simba receives valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end
                     his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful king.</p>

                 <h2>Story Summary</h2>
                 <center> <img src="https://www.koimoi.com/wp-content/new-galleries/2022/09/lion-king-prequel-titled-mufasa-the-lion-king-001.jpg" alt="pinocchio" height="45%" width="45%"></center>
             <p>The Lion King is about a young lion named Simba, who is the crown prince
                of an African Savanna. His father Mufasa is training Simba to become king of the pride lands.
                However, we learn that Mufasa's brother Scar is jealous of Mufasa and Simba's right to the
                throne. He plots with a large pack of hyaenas to overthrow Mufasa and scare Simba away.
                Scar stages an accident that leads to Mufasa's demise, while making Simba feel responsible
                for the passing of his father. He tells Simba he should run for his life instead of take
                responsibility for the accident which Simba thinks he caused, though he didn't. Simba runs
                away as advised, and meets a warthog named Pumbaa and a meerkat named Timon. Pumbaa
                and Timon have been living as social outcasts for a long time, and they teach Simba their
                ways until he is an adult. Soon after, Nala, Simba's childhood friend, finds him and tells him
                his uncle Scar has been a horrible leader and they need Simba to return. At first Simba is
                afraid of facing what he thinks he did so many years ago and needs much convincing, but
                after a vision of his father, he returns to Pride Rock with Nala and overthrows Scar's reign.</p>
                <p>In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill,
                     the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne.</p>
                     <p>After Simba grows into a cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and explains the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life," which connects all living things. One day, Simba and his best friend Nala explore an elephant graveyard, where the two are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed.
                        Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar, having planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to 
                       help him kill both Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.</p>

                    <p>Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him.
                         Mufasa saves Simba but winds up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede to his death. Scar tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. Once Simba flees, Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who manages to escape. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both
                         Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.</p>
                         <p>After he collapses in a desert, Simba is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto "hakuna matata" ("no worries" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him
                             to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.</p>
                             <p>Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he is the one who killed Mufasa. Enraged by the revelation, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. A battle breaks out, and Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar's life but, quoting what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but after a brief battle, Simba throws him off the ledge to the ground below.
                                 Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and eat him.</p>
                                 <p>With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals,
                                     continuing the circle of life.</p>
                    
                        <h2>Analysis and adaptations</h2>
                        
                       <p>Growing up is a difficult process and often requires a certain level of failure. In The Lion King, Simba makes a mistake at an attempt to be brave that nearly costs lives. </p>
                       <p>Once he learns of the kingship he will inherit, he becomes reckless and disobeys his father by bringing Nala to the elephant graveyard, and both are almost killed by a pack of hyenas. Mufasa, Simba’s father, criticizes Simba’s reckless attempt at bravery: “Being brave doesn’t mean you go looking for trouble” (The Lion King).</p>
                       <p>By saying this, Mufasa is trying to teach his son a lesson about growing up to be a proper king because he failed to understand what bravery requires. Though being chastised for his failure hurt Simba emotionally, this lesson was successful because Simba never looks for trouble to show off his bravery again. Anyone who grows, even a future king like Simba, must experience failure early on to construct an understanding of the world; therefore, people learn and grow from their experience to avoid later mistakes that could be costly. </p>
                        
                       <h2>Franchise</h2>
                       <p>The franchise mainly revolves about a pride of lions who oversee a large swath of African savanna as their "kingdom" known as the Pride Lands, with their leader Simba watching over it as "king". </p>
