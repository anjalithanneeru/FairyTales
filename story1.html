                <p> "The Adventures of Pinocchio. Story of a Puppet", commonly shortened to Pinocchio, is a children's fantasy novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi. It is about the mischievous adventures of an animated marionette named Pinocchio and his father, a poor woodcarver named Geppetto.
             <br>It was originally published in a serial form as The Story of a Puppet (Italian: La storia di un burattino) in the Giornale per i bambini, one of the earliest Italian weekly magazines for children, starting from 7 July 1881. The story stopped after nearly 4 months and 8 episodes at Chapter 15,
             but by popular demand from readers, the episodes were resumed on 16 February 1882.[1] In February 1883, the story was published in a single book. Since then, the spread of Pinocchio on the main markets for children's books of the time has been continuous and uninterrupted, and it was met with enthusiastic reviews worldwide.

            <h2>About Author</h2>
            <p>      The tale of the wooden puppet Pinocchio created by a carpenter in Florence may arguably be the most widely-known children's tale. Now new research reveals that the story, written by Carlo Collodi 130 years ago on July 7, 1881, has deep roots in reality.</p>
            <p>The Adventures of Pinocchio is a story about an animated puppet, boys who turn into donkeys, and other fairy tale devices. The setting of the story is the Tuscan area of Italy. It was a unique literary marriage of genres for its time. The story's Italian language is peppered with Florentine dialect features, such as the protagonist's Florentine name.</p>

           <p>As a young man, Collodi joined the seminary. However, the cause of Italian unification (Risorgimento) usurped his calling, as he took to journalism as a means of supporting the Risorgimento in its struggle with the Austrian Empire.[7] In the 1850s, Collodi began to have a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books published. Once, he translated some French fairy-tales so well that he was asked whether he would like to write some of his own. In 1848, Collodi started publishing Il Lampione, a newspaper of political satire. With the founding of the Kingdom of Italy
             in 1861, Collodi ceased his journalistic and militaristic activities and began writing children's books.</p>
             <p>Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the recently unified Italy, including Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino ("Little Johnny's voyage through Italy"; 1876), a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, and Minuzzolo (1878).[8] In 1881, he sent a short episode in the life of a wooden puppet to a friend who edited a newspaper in Rome, wondering whether the editor would be interested in publishing this "bit of foolishness"
                 in his children's section. The editor did, and the children loved it.</p>

                 <center> <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/z73WsxHdk_4B7sCDOSHvLA71Ivg/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/12/13/681/n/1922283/f7b0c6d235fd4b6e_MSDPINO_WD017/i/Pinocchio-1940.jpg" alt="pinocchio" height="40%" width="40%"></center>
             <p>One day, Geppetto, the puppeteer, decides to make a wonderful puppet. As he is crafting it, he says, "I think I'll call him Pinocchio." However, the unfinished puppet is already playing pranks on him. Its nose grows and grows no matter how much he cuts it. Once given a mouth, the puppet sticks its tongue out at him. Finally, it steals his wig before running out of the tiny house.

                Geppetto gives chase until, finally, a policeman grabs Pinocchio by his long nose. The policeman takes Geppetto to jail for the disturbance and sends Pinocchio home. At home, Pinocchio finds a cricket on the wall. The cricket says that it has been living in that room for a hundred years and warns the puppet of the ill that befalls all children who refuse to listen to their parents. This angers Pinocchio so much that he smashes the cricket with a hammer.</p>
                <p>That night, Pinocchio falls asleep in front of the fire and does not notice as his feet burn away. When Geppetto returns the next morning, Pinocchio promises to be a good boy and to go to school if only Geppetto will make him new feet. Geppetto agrees. He also sells his winter coat to buy Pinocchio a schoolbook. Understanding the sacrifice made on his behalf, Pinocchio kisses his father.</p>
                <p>The next day, Pinocchio hears the sound of pipe music. Forgetting his promises, he follows the music to a puppet theater, selling his schoolbook to gain entry. Once inside, the puppets bring him on stage to dance and sing. This angers Fire Eater, the puppet master, who vows to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his supper. When Pinocchio cries in fear, Fire Eater feels sorry for him and decides to burn another puppet instead. Pinocchio then says he will go willingly to the fire pit to save the other puppet. This touches Fire Eater. He frees Pinocchio and gives him five gold pieces.

                <p>On the way home, Pinocchio meets a lame fox and a blind cat; he shows them his gold pieces. In their excitement at seeing the money, they nearly reveal themselves (for they are not really blind or lame). They tell Pinocchio of a certain field where, if he buries his gold pieces, will grow it into 2,000 gold pieces. The puppet agrees. As Pinocchio goes to the field, he sees the ghost of the talking cricket. It tells him not to listen to the fox and cat, but to go home to his weeping father. Pinocchio scoffs at the advice and continues on his way. 
                    At the field, he buries the gold pieces and leaves. When he later returns for his expected bounty, he finds only a hole in the ground. A parrot laughs at him and explains that the cat and fox stole his money. Pinocchio reports the theft to the police chief, who throws him into jail for being a simpleton.

                <p>Five months later, Pinocchio is finally released from jail. A pigeon arrives to tell him that Geppetto has set sail in hopes of finding his missing son. Pinocchio swims out in search of his father, and after asking a dolphin, learns that his father was swallowed by a giant shark. Pinocchio keeps swimming, eventually finding himself in the Land of Busy Bees.

                    Hungry, Pinocchio begs for food, but the people, instead, offer him jobs so that he can work for food. The lazy puppet refuses until an old woman promises him supper in exchange for carrying water jugs. He reluctantly agrees, and the old woman turns out to be a fairy. Confessing that he wants to grow into a man, Pinocchio lives with the fairy for a time. He attends school and is a star pupil.</p>
                    <p>One day, Pinocchio's best friend, a boy named Lampwick, says he is going to the Land of Toys. He boards a wagon pulled by weeping donkeys. Pinocchio joins him, and the wagon takes them to a world populated only with young boys. For months, the boys spend their days being lazy, until one morning, they wake to find they have become donkeys. Each is sold at the market; Pinocchio is bought by a musician who only wants his hide to make a drum. The musician ties a stone around his neck and drops him into the sea. The fairy changes him back to a puppet to prevent him from drowning, but he is swallowed by the giant shark.</p>
                    <p>In the shark's belly, Pinocchio finds Geppetto, who has been obliged to stay there for two years because he cannot swim. That night, when the shark goes to sleep with its mouth open, Pinocchio swims out with Geppetto on his shoulders. When they reach shore, Geppetto is old and sick from his years in the shark, so Pinocchio finds work at a nearby farm. At night, he applies himself to schoolwork. Gradually, Geppetto's strength returns.

                        One day, Pinocchio learns the fairy is sick in the hospital, so he gives all his money (50 pennies) for her care. The next day, he wakes to find himself changed into a real boy, and the shabby cottage he shares with Geppetto is now a fine house. The puppeteer explains, "When bad boys become good and kind, they have the power of making their homes bright and new with happiness."</p>
                    
                        <h2>Analysis and adaptations</h2>
                        
                        <p>Collodi’s original serial, which was titled Le avventure di Pinocchio: storia di un burattino (“The Adventures of Pinocchio: The Story of a Puppet”), was meant to serve as a warning against bad behaviour, and it ended with Pinocchio’s fatal hanging. The disappointment of the story’s fans, however, led Collodi’s publishers to insist that he resurrect Pinocchio and continue the puppet’s adventures.

                            Like many Tuscan folk tales, Pinocchio has important moral lessons for children: e.g., disobedience does not pay, telling lies is seldom prudent, and boys who love and take care of their parents will be rewarded. Its pedagogical mission notwithstanding, the story remains a timeless classic. It was translated into numerous languages, with an English-language version first appearing in 1892, and it was released under a number of titles. In addition, the book was adapted for film, television, and theatre. The Disney film is the best-known adaptation, though it is significantly different than the book,
                             which is darker and portrays Pinocchio as more selfish and aggressive. However, the book has some humorous slapstick that is absent from the Disney version.</p>
