                <p>"This satisfying tale never grows old." -Yellow Brick Road</p>
                <p>Cinderella, the most popular of all fairy tales, is a time-less story of virtue rewarded. Sweet, beautiful Cinderella, cruelly mistreated by her evil stepmother and stepsisters, 
                    is helped by her magical fairy godmother, who sends her off to win the heart of a handsome prince and live happily ever after. Anthea Bell’s graceful translation of this classic tale is faithful to the original, yet accessible to today's children.</p>
            
                 <p> "Illustrations featuring mix of styles in both clothing and architecture set the story in an imaginary yet vaguely familiar landscape, lit by a dreamlike haze. The smoothly told story...contains the familiar details and a happy ending in which Cinderella forgives her step-family." </p>      
            
            <h2>About Author</h2>
            <p>Charles Perrault (/pɛˈroʊ/ perr-OH, US also /pəˈroʊ/ pə-ROH, French: [ʃaʁl pɛʁo]; 12 January 1628 – 16 May 1703) was a French author and member of the Académie Française. He laid the foundations for a new literary genre, the fairy tale, with his works derived from earlier folk tales, published in his 1697 book Histoires ou contes du temps passé (Stories or Tales from Past Times). </p>
            
            <img align="left" src="https://149455152.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Complete-Fairy-Tales.jpg" alt="Author" height="10%" width="10%">
            <p>The best known of his tales include Le Petit Chaperon Rouge ("Little Red Riding Hood"), Cendrillon ("Cinderella"), Le Maître chat ou le Chat botté ("Puss in Boots"),
                La Belle au bois dormant ("Sleeping Beauty"), and Barbe Bleue ("Bluebeard").</p>
           <p>Some of Perrault's versions of old stories influenced the German versions published by the Brothers Grimm more than 100 years later. The stories continue to be printed and have been adapted to most entertainment formats. Perrault was an influential figure in the 17th-century French literary scene,
             and was the leader of the Modern faction during the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns.</p>
             <p>Some of his popular stories, particularly Cinderella[19] and The Sleeping Beauty, are still commonly told similar to the way Perrault had written them, while others have been revised over the years. For example, some versions of Sleeping Beauty published today are based partially on a Brothers Grimm tale, "Little Briar Rose", a modified version of the Perrault story.</p>
              <p>He had actually published his collection under the name of his last son (born in 1678), Pierre (Perrault) Darmancourt ("Armancourt" being the name of a property he bought for him), probably fearful of criticism from the "Ancients".[24] In the tales, he used images from around him, such as the Chateau Ussé for The Sleeping Beauty, and the Marquis of the Château d'Oiron as the model for the Marquis de Carabas in Puss in Boots. He ornamented his folktale subject matter with details, asides and subtext drawn from the world of fashion. Following up on these tales,
                 he translated the Fabulae Centum (100 Fables) of the Latin poet Gabriele Faerno into French verse in 1699.</p>

             <p>The storyline opens in a tiny kingdom, and shows us a chateau, wherein lives a widowed gentleman, and his daughter, Cinderella. Feeling that his daughter needed "a mother's care," he remarried a woman with two daughters of her own, named Anastasia, and Drizella.

                However, upon the death of Cinderella's father, her Stepmother reveals a cruelty and jealous towards Cinderella's charms and beauty.
                
                The Stepmother chooses to focus all her attention to that of her own daughters, leading to a downfall of the family estate. The chateau soon falls into disrepair, and the family fortune is spent up on the two Stepdaughters.
                <p>In the end, Cinderella is forced into becoming a servant in her own household, attending to her Stepfamily, and living in a high tower on the family property. Even though her life's conditions are deplorable, she still tries to keep herself going, by dreaming of a better life someday. She befriends a number of little birds and mice, of which she has made little clothing for several of them.

                    One day, a little mouse named Jacque informs her that a new mouse has been caught in a trap. The rotund little mouse is at first scared, but upon Jacque and Cinderella welcoming him, they give him some clothes, and a new name: Octavius...but for short, they call him Gus.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jacque and some other mice show Gus around the house, and out into the yard behind the house to get corn that Cinderella is giving the other animals. However, in their attempts to return to the mice at the top of Cinderella's tower, they run into the Stepmother's cat, named Lucifer. Lucifer then attempts to get Gus, who hides in a teacup that is given to one of Cinderella's Stepsisters.
                    </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, in the Kingdom's Castle, The King is having an argument with the Grand Duke</p>
                    <p>Later on that day, a royal messenger shows up at the chateau with an invitation. Cinderella delivers it to her Stepfamily, and upon hearing the proclamation, grows happy that she can also attend, given that it invites "every eligible maiden."

                        However, her Stepmother says she can go, "if" she can complete all her chores, and "if" she can find something suitable to wear.</p>

                    <p>Cinderella quickly returns to her room, and finds an old dress that was once her Mother's. As she looks in a sewing book on ways to improve it, she is called away by her Stepfamily.Jacques and Gus rush off to get some extra trimming for the dress,
                         and encounter the Stepsisters and Stepmother ordering Cinderella around with extra chores</p>
                         <p>After the Stepmother ushers her daughters out the door, Cinderella rushes out of the chateau and into the garden, crying on a bench, that no matter how hard she tries to believe, things will never get better for her. However, she suddenly hears a voice, and encounters an cheerful woman in a light-blue cloak. The woman claims she is her Fairy Godmother, and intends to help Cinderella go to the ball.

                            Using her magic wand, the Godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach, 4 of the mice into horses, the farm's horse into a coachman, and the family dog into a footman. The final touch is fixing Cinderella's dress, which is turned into a beautiful white gown, complete with glass slippers.</p>
                            <p>The Prince then leads Cinderella out into the Palace Gardens, where they dance and wander. However, when the clock suddenly strikes midnight, Cinderella flees. The Grand Duke attempts to stop her, but she flees down the Palace's entry steps, leaving behind a glass slipper. A series of Palace Horsemen attempt to catch the coach, but eventually, the 12th chime of midnight strikes, Cinderella's entourage returns to normal, and rush off the main road, as the Horsemen's steeds trample what's left of the now-normal pumpkin.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, as the Duke's footman brings the slipper, the Stepmother causes him to trip on her cane, sending the slipper flying to the floor, where it shatters!

                                The Duke is beside himself, over what will happen to him, but it is then that Cinderella claims that he shouldn't worry, as she has the other slipper! She then produces it (much to the surprise of her Stepmother), and the Duke places it on her foot, where it fits perfectly!
                                
                                The final images of the film are of Cinderella being married to the Prince, with her mice and bird friends watching her get into a carriage, and riding off to a Happily Ever After.</p>

                             that it too could go to Hollywood and see all the wonderful stories that had been invited there.</p>
                             <p>But then! Seemingly out of nowhere, a fairy god-producer appeared in a sparkling cloud of smog. "Cinderella, darling," she said to the sad fairy tale, smiling serenely through her Botox, "Why are you crying?"
