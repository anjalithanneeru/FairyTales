                <p>The ugly duckling, outcast and misunderstood by the other animals, goes on a journey to discover a place where he will fit in… only to become triumphant when he emerges as the most beautiful swan of all, always destined to stand out.

                     <p><b>"The Ugly Duckling"</b>(Danish: Den grimme ælling) is a Danish literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875). It was first published on 11 November 1843 in New Fairy Tales. First Volume. First Collection, with three other tales by Andersen in Copenhagen, Denmark to great critical acclaim. The tale has been adapted to
                         various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is an original story by Andersen</p>
             
            
    <h2>About Author</h2>

            <p>Hans Christian Andersen 2 April 1805 - 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his literary fairy tales.</p>
            <p>Andersen's fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes,[1] have been translated into more than 125 languages.[2] They have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.</p>

            <p>His most famous fairy tales include "The Emperor's New Clothes", "The Little Mermaid", "The Nightingale", "The Steadfast Tin Soldier", "The Red Shoes", "The Princess and the Pea", "The Snow Queen", "The Ugly Duckling", "The Little Match Girl", and "Thumbelina". His stories have inspired ballets, plays, and animated and live-action films.</p>
             
            <p>Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805. He had a stepsister named Karen.[5] His father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class,[6] but investigations have disproved these stories).[6][7] Although it has been challenged,[6] a persistent speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King Christian VIII. Danish historian
             Jens Jørgensen supported this idea in his book H.C. Andersen, en sand myte [a true myth].</p>
             <p>He later said that his years at this school were the darkest and most bitter years of his life. At one particular school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused and was told that it was done in order "to improve his character".
                 He later said that the faculty had discouraged him from writing, which then resulted in a depression.</p>

                   
    <h2>Story Summary</h2>
             <center> <img src="https://childrenbookillustrators.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/281_The_Ugly_Duckling-min.jpg" alt="uglyducky" height="40%" width="40%"></center>
             <p>'The Ugly Duckling', in summary, tells of a mother duck, whose eggs are hatching. The last of her baby birds to hatch is a larger bird than the other ducklings, and the other birds - and the other animals around on the farm - consider it to be 'ugly'. They mock and vilify him, and he leaves his mother and siblings behind.

                He encounters some wild geese (technically, ganders as they are male birds, strutting about),
                 and narrowly avoids being killed when hunters turn up with guns and dogs and shoot the geese.</p>
            <p>The ugly duckling keeps wandering, until he arrives at the home of an old woman. Here, once again, he isn't there long before he is taunted and abused by the woman's cat and hen: the hen dismisses the ugly duckling's longing to glide upon the water, saying that she (the hen) is cleverer than him and it's a
                     stupid idea. Once more, the ugly duckling leaves and continues on his way</p>
                     <p>The ugly duckling comes upon a flock of swans, and longs to join them, but he is unable to fly. He is delighted and excited, but he cannot join them, for he is too young and cannot fly. The duckling endures a harsh winter in a cave,
                         and when spring arrives, he sees a flock of swans gliding on the lake</p>
            <img align="right" src="https://media.tenor.com/AfPunsU3h48AAAAC/mad-tom-and-jerry.gif" alt="img" height="30%" width="30%">

                <p>The miserable duckling has given up on life by this point, and decides to throw himself into the path of the large swans and be killed, so he 
                    cannot be abused and rejected for being 'ugly' any more. But - surprise, surprise - the swans don't devour him but instead welcome him with open arms (or wings) as one of their own.</p>
                    <p>And when the ugly duckling catches sight of his own reflection in the water, he realises he is not an ugly duckling any more, but a beautiful, elegant swan. Having realised his beauty and found his family, this majestic swan takes flight with the flock of swans, happy at last.</p>
                     <p></p>
            
    <h2>Analysis and adaptations</h2>
                        
                        <p>The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two Silly Symphonies animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called The Ugly Duckling. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in Technicolor. The latter film won the 1939 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons),[4] and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short "The Little Stranger", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks.

                            In 1932, Yasuji Murata directed Ahiru no ko (The Ugly Duckling), a 15-minute Japanese short animated film based on the tale.</p>
                            <p>In 1956, the Soviet animation studio Soyuzmultfilm produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.[5] The anime Princess Tutu is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. The 1954 Tom and Jerry cartoon Downhearted Duckling is also based on the famous story.</p>
                            <p>In 1999, Jerry Pinkney adapted the story as a children's picture book.</p>
                            <p>In November 2017, a Youtube Channel by the name of The Uncle Louie Variety Show made their own version of the story called "The Ugly Baby".</p>
