                <p>The Jungle Book, collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling, published in 1894. The Second Jungle Book, published in 1895, contains stories linked by poems.

                    The stories tell mostly of Mowgli, an Indian boy who is raised by wolves and learns self-sufficiency and wisdom from the jungle animals. The book describes the social life of the wolf pack and, more fancifully, the justice and natural order of life in the jungle. Among the animals whose tales are related in the work are Akela the wolf; Baloo the brown bear; Shere Khan, the boastful Bengal tiger who is Mowgli’s enemy; Tabaqui the jackal, Shere Khan's
                     obsequious servant; Kaa the python; Bagheera the panther; and Rikki-tikki-tavi the mongoose.</p>
                <p>The Jungle Book story is a collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. The Mowgli story is about a young boy wandering in a Jungle. The wolf family adopted the young boy and named him Mowgli. Mowgli's village is attacked by
                         the brutal tiger Sher Khan and he gets somewhere lost in the trouble and runs into the jungle.</p>
                <p>There, the Mowgli met the wise bear “Baloo”, the black panther “Bagheera”, and the rest of his animal friends and they had adventure after adventure. In the end, Mowgli observed humans but he decided to stay away from them and live with Baloo,
                     Baghera, and the rest of his animal friends in the Jungle.</p>
            
            <h2>About Author</h2>
            <p><b>Joseph Rudyard Kipling </b>was an English novelist, short-story writer, poet, and journalist. He was born in British India, which inspired much of his work.</p>
            <p>Kipling's works of fiction include the Jungle Book duology (The Jungle Book, 1894; The Second Jungle Book, 1895), Kim (1901), the Just So Stories (1902) and many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888). His poems include "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden" (1899), and "If—" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story.
                His children's books are classics; one critic noted "a versatile and luminous narrative gift".</p>

           <p>Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom's most popular writers. Henry James said "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known."[3] In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, its youngest recipient to date.[6] He was also
             sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both.</p>
             <p>Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age.</p>
             <p>Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: "[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes,
                 he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced.</p>
                 <p>That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.</p>

                 <center> <img src="https://usustatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/the-jungle-book-1967-di-01-1050x591.jpg" alt="pinocchio" height="40%" width="40%"></center>

            <p>The Jungle Book Mowgli story is a story of a young boy who has been raised by wolves in the Jungle, since his childhood. The wolf family raised the baby as their own. The young boy Mowgli learned to take care of himself in the jungle, but his friend the black panther “Bagheera” was always nearby.
                  He was always prepared to protect the young boy, Mowgli. The Mowgli became part of the wolf pack, and Baloo, the old bear, and Bagheera, the black panther, taught him the law of the jungle. Mowgli's most dangerous enemy in the jungle was Sher Khan. He was the man-eating tiger in the jungle and wanted to kill the man-cub “Mowgli”
                 before he had a chance to become a man living in the jungle.</p>
                 <p>The leader of the wolves said there is only one way to protect Mowgli from Sher Khan is to take him to the man's jungle.
                     Bagheera agreed to take Mowgli to the man's jungle. But, when Mowgli heard this, he started crying. He said, “No! I want to stay in the jungle”.</p>
                     <p>He did not listen to Bagheera and ran into the jungle. But, Mowgli was not alone in the jungle for long. Within days, he met with a jungle bear named Baloo. After a while, both Mowgli and Baloo went swimming in the river. </p>

                <p>One day, a monkey took Mowgli to the prisoner who lived in an abandoned city in the Jungle. Both Baloo and Bagheera get help from the Kaa, the Python and rescue him.  As the Mowgli got older he was in great danger from Sher Khan. The one thing that Sher Khan was afraid of in the Jungle was a fire.  So, the Mowgli decided to go to a nearby village and decided to steal a pot with a fire in it. Mowgli used fire to fight with Sher Khan. He knew that he would have to kill Sher Khan to be safe in the Jungle. </p>
                <p>As Mowgli gets older, the other animals in the jungle realise that he can’t live with them in the Jungle as a grown man. Mowgli decided to return to the village where he was adopted by a family. But Sher Khan found him. This time, Mowgli killed Sher Khan. But, the villagers were afraid of Mowgli, so they chased him away and he returned to live in the Jungle.</p>
                <p>The most important life lesson taught by the story “Jungle Book” is not to be a coward. Instead, we need to confidently face our fears and triumph over them. This is shown beautifully in the story of how bravely and confidently  Mowgli faces the Tiger - Sher Khan. Also, the story teaches how to lead a simple and happy life.</p>
                <p>In the Jungle Book story, a human child raised by wolves must face off against a threatened tiger named Shere Khan, as well as his own origins. The story follows the raising of a human child named Mowgli by a pack of wolves in the forest.</p>

                        <h2>Analysis and adaptations</h2>
                        <p>The Jungle Book has been adapted many times in a wide variety of media. In literature, Robert Heinlein wrote the Hugo Award-winning science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), when his wife, Virginia, suggested a new version of The Jungle Book, but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves.[32][33] Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book (2008) is inspired by The Jungle Book. It follows a baby boy who is found and brought up by the dead in a cemetery.
                             It has many scenes that can be traced to Kipling, but with Gaiman's dark twist.</p>
                             <p>In music, the Jungle Book cycle (1958) was written by the Australian composer Percy Grainger, an avid Kipling reader. It consists of quotations from the book, set as choral pieces and solos for soprano, tenor or baritone.[35] The French composer Charles Koechlin wrote several symphonic works inspired by the book. BBC Radio broadcast an adaptation on 14 February 1994 and released it as a BBC audiobook in 2008.[36] It was directed by Chris Wallis with Nisha K. Nayar as Mowgli, Eartha Kitt as Kaa,
                                 Freddie Jones as Baloo, and Jonathan Hyde as Bagheera. The music was by John Mayer.</p>
                                 <p>The book's text has been adapted for younger readers with comic book adaptations such as DC Comics Elseworlds' story, "Superman: The Feral Man of Steel", in which an infant Superman is raised by wolves,
                                     while Bagheera, Akela, and Shere Khan make appearances.</p>
